    <h1>Which MCU Movies Should I Watch?</h1>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <header><a href="MarvelTracker.html"><em>Return to Main Page</em></a></header>
    <h3>What is the Point of This App?</h3>
    <p>There are 23 movies and counting in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You may have have seen a few of them, and
        there may be a few you want to see. (If you want to watch all 23 movies, this app is pointless for you!!)
        When you watch the movies you've been wanting to see, you probably will want to have seen a few other movies
        first so you have proper context for the movies you're watching. This app will give you recommendations for
        which other movies to watch first.</p>
    <h4>Why Did I Get Fewer Movies Than I Requested?</h4>
    <p>The algorithms recommend you movies to watch before you watch your selected movies. You will never be recommended
    movies released after your newest selected movie, which can result in fewer recommendations
    than you requested.</p>
    <h3>What Does Each Heuristic Do?</h3>
    <h4>Most Interconnected</h4>
    <p>Selecting the Most Interconnected option will get you a set of movies which have characters, plotlines, etc that
        are all highly interconnected with the movies you've seen, the movies you want to watch, and each other. Note:
        if the movies you want to watch are not highly interconnected with many other movies, you will likely end up
        being recommended movies which are highly interconnected with each other, and only somewhat related to the
        movies you've been wanting to watch.
    </p>
    <h4>Most Relevant</h4>
    <p>Selecting the Most Relevant option will get you a set of movies which have characters, plotlines, etc that
        are most relevant to the movies you want to watch. These movies may not be very related to each other; they are
        only guaranteed to be relevant to your selected movies. (Note: If you request more movies than the number of
        relevant movies to your selections, you will still be served the full number of movies you selected. The extra
        movies will be movies which are very interconnected with the movies relevant to your selected movies.)
    </p>
    <h4>Most Recent</h4>
    <p>Selecting the Most Recent option does not simply recommend you the movies released most recently to your selected
        movies. It gets rid of any movies that don't include characters, plotlines, etc that are present in your
        selected movies. For example, the 3 most recently released movies before <em>Black Panther</em> are
        <em>Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2</em>, <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>, and <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>. But
        nothing in these movies is relevant to <em>Black Panther</em>, so the Most Recent option will skip those and
        instead recommend you<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, <em>Ant-Man</em>, and <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>.
    </p>
    <h3>How Do The Algorithms Work?</h3>
    <p>The set of films is modeled as a directed acyclic weighted graph, where each vertex represents a film. Connections
        between the films are represented as edges between the vertices, with stronger connections having higher weights.
        The way the films are selected from this graph is dependent on which heuristic you choose.
    </p>
    <h4>How are the weights chosen?</h4>
    <p>The weights are based on a highly subjective scale, which is based on my highly subjective evaluation
        of the relevance of each film to each other film. In order to try to reduce the subjectivity of the weights, I
        standardized them as best as I could. For the full set of weight rules, click <a href="Weights.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>How are ties broken?</h4>
    <p>Within the algorithm, ties are generally broken by the little microconnections between movies, which are given a
        weight of 1 for this purpose. However, sometimes 2 or 3 sets of movies end up being equally good based on the
        metrics used here. These ties are broken by a series of 3 metrics, each of which only comes into play if the
        previous metric fails to break the tie:
    <ol>
        <li>Which set of movies has the highest weight if we ignore the movies you've already seen?</li>
        <li>Which movies have the highest Rotten Tomatoes scores? (As this is designed for more casual viewers,
        if 2 sets of movies are equally relevant, you might as well pick the movies considered the best.)</li>
        <li>Which movies are connected to the most other movies, including movies you aren't going to be recommended?</li>
    </ol>
