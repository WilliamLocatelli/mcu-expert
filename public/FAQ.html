    <h1><a href="/">Which Marvel Movies Should I Watch?</a></h1>
    <h2 class="subheading">For casual viewers who don't want to watch every movie.</h2>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>General</h3>
    <h4>What is the point of this app?</h4>
    <p>There are 23 movies and counting in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You may have have seen a few of them, and
        there may be a few you want to see. (If you want to watch all 23 movies, this app is pointless for you!!)
        When you watch the movies you've been wanting to see, you probably will want to have seen a few other movies
        first so you have proper context for the movies you're watching. This app will give you recommendations for
        which other movies to watch first.</p>
    <h4>What does MCU stand for?</h4>
    <p>The MCU is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is the setting of every film made by Marvel Studios, and
        the upcoming Disney+ shows made by Marvel Studios, and many now-cancelled television shows made by Marvel
        Television. For more on this, see <a href="http://en.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
    <h4>Why are Marvel movies like the X-Men films, Fantastic Four, Deadpool, Venom, etc left out?</h4>
    <p>Those movies contain Marvel characters, but they were not made by Marvel Studios, and they do not take place
        in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
    <h3>What Does Each Algorithm Do?</h3>
    <p>The algorithms are currently undergoing revision - these FAQs will be updated when the revisions are complete.</p>
    <h4>Most Interconnected</h4>
    <p>Selecting the Most Interconnected option will get you a set of movies which have characters, plotlines, etc that
        are all highly interconnected with the movies you've seen, the movies you want to watch, and each other. Note:
        if the movies you want to watch are not highly interconnected with many other movies, you will likely end up
        being recommended movies which are highly interconnected with each other, and only somewhat related to the
        movies you've been wanting to watch.
    </p>
    <h4>Most Relevant</h4>
    <p>Selecting the Most Relevant option will get you a set of movies which have characters, plotlines, etc that
        are most relevant to the movies you want to watch. These movies may not be very related to each other; they are
        only guaranteed to be relevant to your selected movies. (Note: If you request more movies than the number of
        relevant movies to your selections, you will still be served the full number of movies you selected. The extra
        movies will be movies which are very interconnected with the movies relevant to your selected movies.)
    </p>
    <h4>Most Recent</h4>
    <p>Selecting the Most Recent option does not simply recommend you the movies released most recently to your selected
        movies. It gets rid of any movies that don't include characters, plotlines, etc that are present in your
        selected movies. For example, the 3 most recently released movies before <em>Black Panther</em> are
        <em>Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2</em>, <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>, and <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>. But
        nothing in these movies is relevant to <em>Black Panther</em>, so the Most Recent option will skip those and
        instead recommend you <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>, <em>Ant-Man</em>, and <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>.
    </p>
    <h3>How does the code work?</h3>
    <p>The set of films is modeled as a weighted directed acyclic graph, where each vertex represents a film. Connections
        between the films are represented as edges between the vertices, with stronger connections having higher weights.
        The way the films are selected from this graph is dependent on which algorithm you choose.
    </p>
    <h4>How are the weights chosen?</h4>
    <p>The weights, which represent the relevance of each film to each other film, have been standardized in order
        to minimize subjectivity. For the full set of weight rules, click <a href="Weights.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>How are ties broken?</h4>
    <p>Within the algorithm, ties are generally broken by the little microconnections between movies, which are given a
        weight of 1 for this purpose. However, sometimes 2 or 3 sets of movies end up being equally good based on the
        metrics used here. These ties are broken by a series of 3 metrics, each of which only comes into play if the
        previous metric fails to break the tie:
    <ol>
        <li>Which set of movies has the highest weight if we ignore the movies you've already seen?</li>
        <li>Which movies have the highest Rotten Tomatoes scores? (As this is designed for more casual viewers,
        if 2 sets of movies are equally relevant, you might as well pick the movies considered the best.)</li>
        <li>Which movies are connected to the most other movies, including movies you aren't going to be recommended?</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Does this project use Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h4>
    <p>Artifical Intelligence is poorly defined. In what is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect">
        AI effect</a>, as soon as a task becomes achievable by computers, the ability to perform that task is no longer
        perceived as requiring intelligence. The task of telling someone what movies they should watch might sound like
        something you would only expect a human to be able to do, but the programming strategies used for this project
        would not be considered AI by most programmers.</p>
