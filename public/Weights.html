    <h2>Edge Weight Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Connection weights are standardized to values of 10 (strong connection), 5 (semistrong connection), 3
            (semiweak connection), or 1 (weak connection).</li>
        <li>The weight of an edge is equal to the <strong>highest</strong> weight of any connection between the two films. This means
            that if a film has 3 very strong connections to another film, the edge is given a weight of 10, and if a
            film has only 1 very strong connection to another film, it is also given a weight of 10.</li>
        <li>Edges of weight less than 5 do not make a film a candidate for inclusion in recommendations. <!--Example:
            In <em>Iron Man 3</em>,
            Aldrich Killian says "Ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had
            its day." This doesn't mean you should watch <em>Thor</em> first if you want see <em>Iron Man 3</em>, so
            it's really only used as a tie breaker.</li>-->
        <li>Connection weights are chosen based on two types of criteria: internal references to previous movies, and
            external definition of relationship to previous movies. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>External definitions:</h3>
    <h4>10</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>This movie is explicitly defined as a direct sequel to the previous movie.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>5</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>This movie is explicitly defined as a sequel to the previous movie, but not a direct sequel.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Internal references:</h3>
    <h4>10</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The way the viewer understands most or all of this movie will depend on whether they have seen most or all of
            this previous movie.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>5</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Something that is a BIG part of this movie relates back to something that is a SMALL part of the previous movie.</li>
        <li>Some scenes or plot points in this movie will be understood very differently by the viewer if they have seen this
         previous movie.</li>
        <li>This previous movie was the most recent appearance of one or more of the main characters/plotlines in this
            movie. (Credits scenes don't count.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>A side character who appears in this movie most recently appeared in this other movie, and has a memorable
            appearance in both movies, but does not have any kind of character arc that
            makes the previous movie relevant to this movie.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>1</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>There are some brief moments which reference events of these previous movies, but understanding the context
            of these moments will not in any way affect your understanding of this movie.</li>
        <li>A character who appears in this movie most recently appeared in this previous movie, but their appearance in
            at least one of the two movies was so minor that you may not even remember it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is one more rule that currently only applies to <em>Infinity War</em>/<em>Endgame</em>:</p>
    <h4>20</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>These 2 movies were conceived of, planned, and written at the same time, and for all intents and purposes can be
            seen as 2 halves of the same story.</li>
    </ul>
